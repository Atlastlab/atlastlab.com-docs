# Introduction

## Atlast is an interactive map app. It can be used for events, campings, theme parks, exhibitions, music festivals.

### Focus

The app is map focused, where does the user need to go? Where are the great attractions, where is that good stand of company X? On the map you can find markers of great things, those things (shops, attractions, stands, camping spots) can have popups with info.

### Example: music festival

Take a music festival, you have got a couple of stages, let us say 6, 60 artists, so also 60 biographies, would it not be great if you could see how busy a stage is? When Artist X starts? and what about photo's and videos?

### Example: Exhibition

One great hall, 50 paintings, 6 painters, with Atlast you can enter the painter information and the painting information. With beacons we manage the connection to the painting. So your viewers come and open the app, when they stand for a painting a text about the painting will popup above the map.

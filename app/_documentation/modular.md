# Modular

## Atlast is a modular app. What does that mean, what does it bring?

The app itself has a plugin structure, a plugin for showing a welcome message, a plugin for showing the waiting times for attractions, a plugin for finding your children/friends on the map, a plugin for everything.

Working with plugins will lower the costs for one instance when starting, it will add a small fee per plugin to the monthly costs.

### Customizable

Plugins have settings, a customer can adjust the settings of the plugin. What icons are used, the titles, all these things are adjustable.

### Public plugins

A lot of the plugins are available for everyone. When one customer wants a plugin we will check if it is possible to build it generic and if so we will make it a public plugin. This will lower the price for the plugin development, because we can spread it out.

### Private plugins

An instance of Atlast can also have a special plugin specific for that instance. Cost will be higher.
